Added
-----

*   Add ``lxml`` as an optional dependency.
    This is currently the only way to parse malformed XML files.


Changed
-------

*   Change the name of the ``ListError`` to ``ListparserError``.


Removed
-------

*   HTML entities are no longer automatically injected into the DTD.

    If lxml is installed and undeclared HTML entities are encountered,
    they will be ignored.

    If lxml is not installed and undeclared HTML entities are encountered,
    Python's ``xml.sax`` parser will fail to parse the document.
