listparser.py - Parse OPML subscription lists into a negotiable format.
Copyright (C) 2009 Kurt McKee <contactme@kurtmckee.org>

listparser.py is currently designed to tear through subscription lists
and return all of the feeds that it finds. It only supports OPML, but
will one day support other subscription list formats.


Usage
=====

>>> import listparser
>>> result = listparser.parse( \
... 'http://github.com/kurtmckee/listparser/raw/master/project.opml')

A dictionary will be returned with several keys:
`meta`: information about the subscription list
`feeds`: a list of feeds
`lists`: a list of subscription lists
`bozo`: '1' if there is a problem with the list, '0' otherwise
`bozo_detail`: a description of the problem if `bozo` is True 

Continuing the example:

>>> result['meta']['title']
u'listparser project feeds'
>>> len(result['feeds'])
3
>>> result['feeds'][0].keys()
['url', 'title']


Todo
====

There are plenty of things yet to do! If you have an idea you can
certainly start coding, but if you'd like to contribute and don't
know where to start, wider support of the OPML specification is
probably a good bet.


Bugs
====

There are going to be bugs. The best way to handle them will be to
isolate the simplest possible OPML document that susses out the bug,
add that document as a test case, and then find and fix the problem.

...you can also just report the bug and leave it to someone else
to fix the problem, but that won't be as much fun for you.

Bugs can be reported at <http://github.com/kurtmckee/listparser/issues>
